# Sportify
Sportify is an app that will be made for sports lovers. In this app the users will be allowed to show off their Sports achievements, post videos of their skills, coaches will be recruited by players based on their accomplishments, and a place where a group of people can discuss sports. Also, there would be a section for booking the nearest playground available to play with either a group of friends or with random people, this will allow the playground owners to have profits and publicize their ground. In this feature, we will access the location of the nearby stadiums and grounds. Also, we will have a list of all the sports complexes and grounds in our local town and nearby cities. As of now, this will be a small project which will be worked on and expanded soon. The daily sports news will also be available on that platform. It would allow everyone to know about sports and allow playing which might further help INDIA in various sports competitions such as the Olympics.
Motivation: The main objective of this project is to awaken the youth as well as the old people of INDIA about Sports and help them access the stadiums easily. This will help India win medals and Trophies and make Indian people Fit.
Innovation: This app will work with low-level start-ups to help them grow as well as those talented coaches who are willing to coach players and arenâ€™t able to find a job.
